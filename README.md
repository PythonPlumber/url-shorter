Prepare yourself for non-stop laughter with the Mega Hilarious URL Shrinker, affectionately known as ZLY. This open-source project, developed by the comedic masterminds at PythonPlumber, is here to revolutionize the world of link shortening. Built with <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f40d/512.gif" alt="🐍" width="15" height="15"> Python, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB, ZLY aims to bring a smile to your face while making your URLs shorter than a stand-up comedian's punchline.

Our mission is simple: to provide you with the funniest, easiest-to-use, and most customizable URL shortening service imaginable. Say goodbye to boring, long links and say hello to side-splittingly hilarious short URLs!

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged! If you have any jokes, puns, or comedic ideas to enhance the hilarity of ZLY, we'd love to hear them. Check out our contributing guidelines for more information on how you can join the laughter brigade.

## Getting Started <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f31f/512.gif" alt="🌟" width="32" height="32">

1. Set up a MongoDB database:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account and prepare for some seriously funny data storage.
   - Create a new project and cluster that will serve as the comedic hub for ZLY.
   - Add a new user to the database, ensuring they have the read and write permissions necessary to unleash the laughter.
   - Don't forget to whitelist the IP address of the server where you'll be running the Python code. Laughter has no boundaries, after all!
   - **Add MongoDB Url in env**

2. Set up the backend using Python:
   - Grab your funniest Python hat and install Flask, the jester of Python web frameworks, along with the pymongo library, which will help us interact with MongoDB.
   - Create a new Flask app and define two routes: one for the home page and one for the form submission. Get ready to unleash your comedic genius!
   - In the form submission route, generate a unique short URL and store it, along with the submitted long URL, in the MongoDB database. This is where the magic happens!
   - Return the short URL to the user in the form of a clickable link. Prepare for laughter-induced tears of joy!

## Deploy Your Side-Splitting Site

   - Choose the Git repository where your Flask app is located and let Render do the rest.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy, ensuring it's the funniest branch of all.
   - Configure your app by selecting the appropriate language, build command, and start command.
     - Start Command:
       ```
       gunicorn app:app

     ```
     heroku create <app-name>
     ```
     Replace `<app-name>` with a name that will tickle everyone's funny bone.
   - Install the necessary dependencies for your Flask app by generating a requirements.txt file:
     ```
     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     ```
